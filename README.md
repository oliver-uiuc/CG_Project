# CG_Project 

We developed two 3D games using Threejs. This is a groupwork done in Hong Kong with my team members Mr. Cheng Yifeng and Mr. Song Haoyang. 

## Part 1. Interactive 2.5D Arcade Game

A car drives on a rotating planet, and the main goal is to avoid hitting trees, which are randomly generated on the planet. 


## Part 2: Interactive 3D Open World Game

A helicopter can move in the 3D space freely. We used the Perlin noise to randomly create the topography (infinite and never repeat), including trees, mountains, rivers and clouds. We used Gerstner wave function to simulate water fluctuations. Energy decreases with flight time, and the aviator needs to search for randomly generated energy balls to keep the helicopter flying.
